    <p>My name is Beatriz Recari and I am a former professional golfer and three time winner on the LPGA tour. I turned professional in 2005 when I was eighteen years of age. I competed for four straight seasons until 2009, where I claimed my maiden victory at the Finnair Masters in Finland. In 2010 I started my career on the LPGA, winning in my rookie year. Here it is a summary of my achievements. </p>

        <ul>• 2010 CVS/Pharmacy Classic Champion</ul>
        <ul>• 2013 KIA Classic Champion</ul>
        <ul>• 2013 Marathon Classic Champion</ul>
        <ul>• 2013 Solheim Cup member for Team Europe (Champion)</ul>
        <ul>• 2014 UL International Crown Champion (Team Spain)</ul>
        
        <p>  In 2013 I became the first and only Spanish female golfer to win more than once on tour and multiple times in one season. After a successful career and due to some injuries, I decided to retire from competitive golf in 2022. Ever since, the process of reinventing myself has been challenging but nevertheless exciting and full of growth.</p>
        <p>  In January of 2023, I decided to follow my dream and passion for building and creating new things and possibilities, so I joined the prestigious Boca Code school where I started the ten week Software Engineer Bootcamp. </p>
        
        <p>  As a driven, hard working, disciplined and passionate person, I am dedicated to delivering innovative and high-quality software solutions that meet the needs of clients and users. With expertise in a number of languages like JavaScript , MongoDB, Express, Firebase, etc,</p>
        <p>  I am committed to deliver the best solution and the highest level of work, unconditionally. I am always seeking new challenges, mentorship and opportunities to grow and expand my skills, and I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations in the tech industry to grow with and learn from. I have enjoyed a previous career that has made me a better human, and I would love to apply those life lessons and skills of performing at the highest demand under the biggest pressure, to new fields like computing and software engineer development. </p>
